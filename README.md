# artGarden

## Project Description

artGardenâ„¢ is for new artists who have trouble breaking into the art sphere. artGarden gives equal opportunity for paid gigs to new and established artists by allowing them to connect to potential clients through a unique bidding platform. Unlike other gig marketplace platforms, artGarden allows any registered artist to view and bid on user art commissions, giving the client the ability to set the price point while also giving lesser known artists a chance at taking on a commission that otherwise might not be accessible.
